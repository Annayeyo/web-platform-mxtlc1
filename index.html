  <p>My name is Ananaba Adanna Chidinma, a graduate of Biomedical Technology from Federal University Of Technology, Owerri, who has found love and a resting place in tech.</p>
  <p>Transitioning into tech, has been one of the greatest and best decisions i've made as a person and im super proud of it.</p>
  <p>Growing up, ive always struggled with myself; knowing who i am and what i want to be. and although its taken me more than twodecades of struggles to get here, i'm glad those hours spent, trying to discover who i am and want to be, has led me to this point.</p>
  <p>I want to be a life-changing figure to people around me. i want to inspire people through tech just as Codevixens has inspired me. I want people to look at me and go "ah, i really have alot to learn from her". i want my story to touch hearts and inspire them.</p>
  <p>In 5 years, i see myself behind big screens, coding and creating projects for both startups and big companies like google, microsoft etc. Yes! it isnt too much of a dream. and i know with strongwill, i'd achieve all that ive set my mind to.</p>
  <p><blockquote><q>You Only Live Once</q></blockquote></p>
  <p>This is the motto I live by. and I know with this, i can achieve anything. </p>
